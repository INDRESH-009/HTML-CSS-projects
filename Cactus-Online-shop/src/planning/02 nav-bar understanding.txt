Description of the functioning of the nav bar 
    the nav bar occupies the complete width with some padding on left and right.
    on hover the menu items should transition from white to green
    when we scroll to each section the menu item of that section should be highlighted 
    when the screen size reduces the menu items should disappear and a hamburg menu should appear.

    The hamburg menu must be dynamic . On clicking on it a overlay apperas from the right which contains all the menu items and a close icon on the top right. On clicking the close icon the overlay gets converted back to a hamburg icon.

    Another feature is when we click on any of the menu-items in the overlay should close automatically and that section of the page should appear.
